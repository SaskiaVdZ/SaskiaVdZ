Hi, My name is Saskia! 

I am a curious junior front-end developer who just finished a full-time accelerated vocational course at Sundsgården folkhögskola: IT - Front end Developer for women.

💛 I love to build and create in general but I especially love to create meaning and value.
  
⬛️  I'm currently learning more React at Udemy, studying Flutter at The App brewery and looking forward to dive into Data Visualisation D3.js at the New York University shortly.

⬜️ I am an experienced design professional with more than 20 years of teaching and mentoring experience and a degree in both fine art and spatial design.

🟧 I consider myself a life-long learner, always hungry to study and learn more. I'm a creative problem solver and I like to make things understandable by turning complex stuff into mini bite-size bits and steps.

🟪 I'm dedicated, structured, analytical, curious and not afraid to ask questions. I'm hard working; I can't leave things alone until they are solved:/ 

🟦 I live in a small place called Sångshyttan, in Bergslagen, right in between Stockholm and Oslo. I moved from Amsterdam to Sweden approximately 20 years ago. In my spare time I like to read, write, draw, do yoga and walk with my dog.


🔷 Here are some of my projects:
- My final project at Sundsgården: a game in React Vite
- An expense tracker, in Javascript only
