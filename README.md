<h1>Hi, My name is Saskia</h1>
<br/>

I am a curious junior front-end developer who just finished a full-time accelerated vocational course at SundsgÃ¥rden folkhÃ¶gskola: IT - Front end Developer, Tech for women.

ðŸ’› I love to build and create in general but I especially love to to contribute and create meaning and value.

ðŸŒ± Currently I'm learning more React at Udemy, studying Flutter at The App brewery and looking forward to dive into Data Visualisation D3.js at the New York University, shortly.

â€¢  An experienced design professional with more than 20 years of teaching and mentoring experience.

â€¢  A life-long learner, always hungry to study and learn more.

â€¢Â  A creative problem solver. 

â€¢Â  I like to make complex things understandable by turning them into mini bite-size bits and steps.

â€¢Â  Dedicated, structured, analytical, curious and not afraid to ask questions.

â€¢Â  I can't leave things alone until they are solved:/

ðŸŒ²Â  I live in a small place called SÃ¥ngshyttan, in Bergslagen, right in between Stockholm and Oslo. I moved from Amsterdam to Sweden approximately 20 years ago. In my spare time I like to read, write, draw, do yoga and walk with my dog.
