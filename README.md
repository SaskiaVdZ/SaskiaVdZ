<h1>Hi, My name is Saskia</h1>
<br/>

I am a curious junior front-end developer who just finished a full-time accelerated vocational course at Sundsgården folkhögskola: IT - Front end Developer for women.

💛 I love to build and create in general but I especially love to create meaning and value.

🌱 I'm currently learning more React at Udemy, studying Flutter at The App brewery and looking forward to dive into Data Visualisation D3.js at the New York University shortly.

•  I am an experienced design professional with more than 20 years of teaching and mentoring experience with a degree in both fine art and spatial design.

•  I consider myself a life-long learner, always hungry to study and learn more.

•  I'm a creative problem solver and I like to make things understandable by turning complex stuff into mini bite-size bits and steps.

•  I'm dedicated, structured, analytical, curious and not afraid to ask questions and I can't leave things alone until they are solved:/

🌲  I live in a small place called Sångshyttan, in Bergslagen, right in between Stockholm and Oslo. I moved from Amsterdam to Sweden approximately 20 years ago. In my spare time I like to read, write, draw, do yoga and walk with my dog.
